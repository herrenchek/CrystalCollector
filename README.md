# Crystal Collector
An interactive browser-based game. Players are shown a random number between 19 and 120 at the start of the game. Four crystals are displayed as buttons. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points between 1 and 12 to the player's total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game begins again, a new random number is generated and all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The page is dynamically updated using the jQuery library. You can play [here](https://herrenchek.github.io/CrystalCollector/)! Demo below.
